# Adventure sword

## game
My goal for this project is to create an adventure-type game that utilizes art and some miner animations, you will have a goal to reach and there will be multiple paths that you can take. you can meet enemies that will either present a riddle or a battle. there also will be a shop that you can access at certain points in the game.

## Struggles
Some of the bigest struggles that I had was creating an animated start screen. as I dove into the game I was still struggling with creating walls with collision detection be invisible. I also had lots of struggles with the logic that comes with the walls. Creating enemies was also difficult. But he biggest problem was adding new things to Leval ad time went on and some things needed to be changes and this horribly broke the code.
